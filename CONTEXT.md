# Windows YellowKey (CVE-2026-45585) mitigation context

Context for Claude Code working on the YellowKey pattern in this repo. Read this first.

## The threat

YellowKey (CVE-2026-45585, disclosed May 12 2026) is an unpatched BitLocker bypass. `autofstx.exe` inside the Windows Recovery Environment replays NTFS transaction logs from any attached volume's `System Volume Information\FsTx` folder, deletes `winpeshl.ini`, and drops the attacker into `cmd.exe` with the BitLocker volume unlocked. Brief physical access is enough.

Affects Windows 11, Server 2022, Server 2025. Windows 10 ships a different WinRE component and is not affected. Microsoft published a mitigation on May 19 2026; no full patch yet.

Microsoft's mitigation strips `autofstx.exe` from the WinRE image's Session Manager `BootExecute`. `reagentc /disable` is a heavier alternative that removes WinRE entirely. TPM + PIN blocks the published PoC but not the researcher's withheld variant. USB-block GPOs and BIOS USB-boot blocks do not help: WinRE ignores OS USB policy, and the attack does not boot from the stick.

Referenced from `fleets/workstations.yml` (`policies`, `reports`, `controls.scripts`).

## How detection works

The `windows_yellowkey` osquery extension reads, on every query: OS (registry `ProductName`), WinRE state (`reagentc /info`), BitLocker key protectors (`Get-BitLockerVolume`), and the Fleet `BootExecMitigated` marker. It derives one `state` per host. No snapshot file, no freshness gate, every query is live.

Verdicts (first match wins, in `verdict()` in main.go):

- `not_affected`: Windows 10 or unrecognised SKU
- `mitigated`: BootExecMitigated marker set
- `mitigated_winre_off`: WinRE disabled
- `bitlocker_off`: no protected BitLocker volume
- `exposed`: affected OS + BitLocker on + no mitigation

The report (`windows-yellowkey.reports.yml`) is a one-line `SELECT ... FROM windows_yellowkey`; the verdict logic lives in the extension, not the SQL. A host returns a row only once the extension is loaded.

## Mitigation

`mitigate-windows-yellowkey.ps1` adapts Microsoft's reference script from the CVE-2026-45585 MSRC FAQ:

1. `reagentc /mountre` to mount the WinRE image.
2. `reg load` the offline SYSTEM hive.
3. Walk every ControlSet, strip `autofstx` variants from `Control\Session Manager\BootExecute`, verify by read-back.
4. `reg unload`, `reagentc /unmountre /commit`.
5. `reagentc /disable` + `/enable` to re-seal the BitLocker measurement chain.

Fleet specifics:

- Mount path under `%SystemRoot%\Temp`, ACL-locked to Administrators.
- Mount + edit + unmount in one try/finally so the hive and mount are always released.
- Writes `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Fleet\YellowKey\BootExecMitigated = 1` only when every ControlSet verified clean. The extension reads this marker to report `mitigated`.
- No opt-in gate; Microsoft's strip is safe on every affected host. One-way: no unmitigate. If a patch ships, apply it and clear the marker.

Exit codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | autofstx removed, already absent, or WinRE already disabled |
| 3 | OS not affected (Windows 10 etc.); no action taken |
| 4 | Mount, edit, unmount, or re-seal failed; manual investigation needed |

## Deployment

The `windows-yellowkey-extension` policy checks `osquery_registry` for the `windows_yellowkey` table plugin (`SELECT 1 FROM osquery_registry WHERE registry = 'table' AND name = 'windows_yellowkey' AND active = 1`). It returns one row when the extension is loaded (pass) and zero rows when it is not (fail). Querying the `windows_yellowkey` table directly would error when the extension is absent, which Fleet shows as neither pass nor fail and would not trigger the installer. Failing hosts run `install-yellowkey-extension.ps1`, which downloads the architecture-matching binary, places it under `C:\Program Files\Orbit\extensions\`, registers it in orbit's `extensions.load`, and restarts orbit.

The prebuilt binaries (`windows_yellowkey-amd64.exe`, `windows_yellowkey-arm64.exe`) are committed under `extensions/windows_yellowkey/`. `install-yellowkey-extension.ps1` reads `PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE` and pulls the matching one from the repo's raw URL on `main` (`raw.githubusercontent.com/.../extensions/windows_yellowkey/<asset>`). No release or tag to cut. Rebuild with `make windows` and commit when the extension changes. `.github/workflows/build-extensions.yml` is CI that builds on change and can publish versioned release artifacts on a tag, but the installer does not depend on it. Fleet caps policy `run_script` retries at 3 per failure.

## Style guide for any updates

Fleet "no fluff, no fear" style:

- Short, declarative sentences. Active voice.
- Sentence case headings. No title case.
- No em dashes. Replace with commas, colons, or new sentences.
- Banned words: very, really, actually, basically, essentially, just, powerful, seamless, revolutionary, game-changing.
- Use "hosts" not "endpoints" or "agents".
- Use "BitLocker" only for Windows BitLocker contexts; "disk encryption" generally.
- Copy-ready outputs over explanatory prose.
- Don't add comments that restate the code. Add comments that explain *why* a non-obvious choice was made.

PowerShell specifics:

- `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` for scripts that mutate.
- Empty catch blocks are not allowed. Always surface `$_.Exception.Message`.
- Use `$null -ne $var` not `if ($var)` for value checks; `0` is falsey in PowerShell.
- Structured key:value output via the `Write-State` helper (width 30).

osquery / Go specifics:

- The extension follows the Go Code Review Comments conventions: package comment starts with "Package ...", no silent error discards (log unexpected failures, stay quiet on expected absence such as a missing Fleet registry key), enumerated string values declared as constants, `gofmt` and `go vet` clean.
- osquery integer columns are strings (`"1"` / `"0"`).
- Match table column names exactly between the extension and the report query.

## Working with Claude Code

When making changes:

- Read this file before editing the scripts or the extension.
- The verdict logic lives in `extensions/windows_yellowkey/main.go` (`verdict()`), not in the report YAML. The report just surfaces the `state` column. If you change the verdicts, update the extension, the report description, the README, and the article together.
- After editing the extension, run the build and lint checks below before committing.

Extension build + lint (from `extensions/windows_yellowkey/`):

```bash
gofmt -l .
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go vet .
make windows
```

PowerShell lint (from `lib/windows/scripts/`):

```bash
for f in *.ps1; do
  echo "=== $f ==="
  grep -nE 'catch *\{ *\}' "$f" && echo "  empty catch found" || echo "  ok: no empty catches"
  grep -nE 'if \(\$[a-zA-Z]+(Status|Error|Capable|Available)\)' "$f" && echo "  boolean coercion" || echo "  ok: explicit null"
done
```
